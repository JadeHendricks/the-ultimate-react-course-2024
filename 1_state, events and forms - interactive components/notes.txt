Whenever we update a piece of state in a components, this trigers the component to re-render (creates a new update view for the component)
We change the state we change the UI

Using use state
When using useState(1), we can console.log it and in the console.log we will get an arry of 2 values
- Value 1 = "initialState"
- Value 2 = fn() to change the initialState

The Mechanics of state
We don't do direct DOM manipulatons >  How is the component view updated then? (We change the state we change the UI - React calls the function component again)
- Let's imaging there is a button in the view (that button is clicked and runs setState)
- Now when react sees that the state has been changed, it will automatically re-render the components, which will result in a updated view for this component.
- This process is literally why React is called React in the first place.

More thoughts on state
- Each component has and manages its own state, no matter how amny times we render the same component.
- This means that each instance of a components work individually form each other.
